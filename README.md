# crumb
Simply (but carefully and configurably) tags near the top of a .py file the relative path name of the file at the time of tagging. This is useful when files that belong in some sub/dir/path/name.py end up (or will end up) in a flattened non-heirarchical level space. (Well, useful so long as you tag them *before* they end up in such a place.)
